SUMMARY:DEADLINE EXTENDED TO SUNDAY FOR THOSE ADDING COURSE LATE: Module 1 
	Piazza Small Group Discussion Contributions - Due
LOCATION:Spring 2024 PSY 12000-005 DIS
DESCRIPTION:After completing Video 2 for this module which will be availabl
	e on Wednesday morning\, you should be familiar with the instructions surro
	unding accessing and using Piazza in this class and you are reading to comp
	lete your module 1 posts.  Before doing so\, it's a good idea to also revie
	w the two pinned posts on Piazza titled "HOW TO USE PIAZZA" and "SMALLGROUP
	 POSTING GUIDELINES". \nRemember that normally piazza contributions are due
	 by Friday\, but that you must make two contributions by Sunday for the fir
	st module to give a little extra time to those adding the course late this 
	week.  You will find the small group discussion happening this week in the 
	thread labeled "Module 1 Required Small Group Discussion" .  Post something
	 yourself and respond to someone else (participation credit is all or none\
	, so make sure you both post and respond).  If you want your responses to c
	ount\, make absolutely sure that you post them within the Module 1 Required
	 Small Group Discussion thread that was started by an instructor or TA and 
	is pinned to the top of the board.  This thread is only visible to your ass
	igned small discussion group.  This activity is required for a grade\, but 
	you will need to wait to have your smallgroup discussion grades uploaded ma
	nually by a TA (they should be up by the following Friday after the discuss
	ion closes)\, so sit tight for the grade to appear.  Go ahead and check off
	 for yourself that you completed this activity right after you make your po
	sts\, so you remember that you are done! \n\n\n\nAssignments:\nDEADLINE EXT

SUMMARY:SUGGESTION - Try to have *FIVE* of your SONA credits done by the en
	d of this week to stay on track! - Due
LOCATION:Spring 2024 PSY 12000-005 DIS
DESCRIPTION:You need to finish 15 credits by the end of the semester to rec
	eive credit for PSY 120 (it's a department requirement - all sections of 12
	0 have to do it!).  We suggest averaging one credit per week to finish on t
	ime.  So\, you're on track if you have 5 done by the end of this week (avoi
	d the end of semester rush where appointments might not be available!) PLEA
	SE NOTE THAT trying to finish 5 of your credits by the end of week 5 isn't 
	a hard due date for this course\, or anything that goes into our section's 
	gradebook\, but I am placing this assignment here so it appears on your Bri
	ghtspace calendar as a REMINDER to you to help you stay on track (in short:
	 your grade isn't impacted by whether you check this off by the suggested w
	eek 5 due date - but I find that dropping it as an assignment into the week
	ly modules helps students make a plan to finish their 15 credits by the end
	 of the semester!) If you don't want it to appear as "overdue" when it's no
	t actually a hard deadline for this course\, you can feel free to check it 
	off even if you aren't done  - checking this off or not doesn't impact your
	 grades for the module - it's just to help you stay on track with the depar
	tment research requirement.  Leave it as an "overdue" assignment if you wan
	t the reminder that you are a bit behind!\nVisit the SONA system here to re
	gister for research appointments.  You should have received your login via 
	email:  http://purdue-psych.sona-systems.com/\nSend any questions about you
	r research credits to: psychstudies@purdue.edu \nIf you need more instructi
	ons or information related to the department research requirement\, such as
	 how many you may do online or in person\, you may visit this module: Resea
	rch Requirement Info and SONA Link\n\n\nAssignments:\nSUGGESTION - Try to h

DESCRIPTION:Here is your link to Exam 1. Exam 1 will be made available for 
	a required submission period Thursday -Saturday (11:59 PM) for 72 hours\, F
	eb 29 - March 2.  It will be deployed through the BRIGHTSPACE QUIZZING TOOL
	\, which will be able to randomly select questions of comparable difficulty
	 that cover certain concepts from a pool of several options. Thus\, no two 
	exams will be the same. \nThis exam covers study guide items for modules 2-
	7.  It is timed at 75 minutes and contains 50 multiple choice and true/fals
	e questions very similar to your end of module assessments\, and you get on
	e attempt.  The exam must be COMPLETED (SUBMITTED) by end of day Saturday (
	so DO NOT START IT at 11:58 PM).  Also\, DO NOT CLICK TO START THE EXAM unt
	il you have a reliable internet connection\, a distraction-free environment
	\, and 75 minutes available to take the test.  Once you start the exam\, ev
	en if you exit out\, the timer will continue to run in the background and y
	ou will not be able to get back in to finish later if the time is up! It is
	 *YOUR RESPONSIBILITY* to NOT open the test until you are ready to start (t
	o ensure everyone has the same fair 75 minutes after opening the test and s
	eeing the first question).  After you submit the exam\, immediately verify 
	a grade registered successfully to the gradebook.  If you can't get an accu

	Saturday due date\, just sit tight and wait for a response).  \nPolicies fo
	r your exam submission: The exam is open note and open book and no proctori

	ve received no information about the question content prior to opening it (
	through any format)\, and then you must submit it ON YOUR OWN using the cou

LOCATION:Spring 2024 PSY 12000-005 DIS
DESCRIPTION:Exam 2 opens Tuesday of finals week and is due Thursday of fina
	ls week (11:59 PM).  It will be deployed through the BRIGHTSPACE QUIZZING T
	OOL (link will be provided in this module) which will be able to randomly s
	elect questions of comparable difficulty that cover certain concepts from a
	 pool of several options. Thus\, no two exams will be the same. \nThe exam 
	is timed at 75 minutes and contains 50 multiple choice and true/false quest
	ions (4 pts each) over modules 8-13. A separate link to a separate set of c
	umulative extra credit questions will also be posted covering material from
	 the first half of the course. You get one attempt at each.  The exam must 
	be COMPLETED (SUBMITTED) by end of day Thursday (so DO NOT START IT at 11:5
	8 PM).  Also\, DO NOT CLICK TO START THE EXAM until you have a reliable int
	ernet connection\, a distraction-free environment\, and 75 minutes availabl
	e to take the test.  Once you start the exam\, even if you exit out\, the t
	imer will continue to run in the background and you will not be able to get
	 back in to finish later if the time is up! It is *YOUR RESPONSIBILITY* to 
	NOT open the test until you are ready to start (to ensure everyone has the 
	same fair 75 minutes after opening the test and seeing the first question).
	  After you submit the exam\, immediately verify a grade registered success
	fully to the gradebook.  If you can't get an accurate grade registered succ
	essfully by 11:59 PM Thursday\, you MUST CONTACT a TA prior to 11:59 PM Thu
	rsday. Once the Thursday due date passes\, if you have not contacted anyone
	 with concerns/explanations as to why you have not registered an accurate g
	rade yet\, you will not be eligible for any additional personal support/ass
	istance. (If you did send us a note prior to the Thursday due date\, just s
	it tight and wait for a response).  \nPolicies for your exam submission: Th
	e exam is open note and open book\, and no proctoring software will be used
	 to lock down your computer.  You simply need to have received no informati
	on about the question content prior to opening it (through any format)\, an
	d then you must submit it ON YOUR OWN using the course materials (no collab
	oration with people before\, during\, or after regarding the specific quest
	ions).  You also may not help anyone else with the questions or exam conten
	t while they have their exam open\, or help by giving them information (thr
	ough any format) about question content beforehand. See the syllabus for mo
	re info. Feel free to chat on piazza before Tuesday about any general study
	 guide/content questions - just do not communicate about specific question 
	content once the test is open. Of course\, ensuring everyone is seeing a di
	fferent version of the test will help reduce the temptation to collaborate.
	 :-) We allow a lot of collaboration on other things in this course\, and n
	ow is your chance to show us what you can do on your own.\nEveryone gets on
	e fair shot at each test and is only permitted to open an exam once - once 
	you open the exam\, you are not eligible for a makeup. Do not open it if yo
	u aren't ready to take it.\nMAKEUP POLICY:\nBecause you have a full 3 day w
	indow to submit your test  (and you don't have to be physically present in 
	a classroom)\, we expect people to be able to submit the exam during the re
	quired window. Please take the submission window seriously and don't open t
	he 75 minute test at the last minute on Thursday. Recall that the syllabus 
	states that if you can't get an accurate grade registered by the Thursday d
	ue date\, you MUST contact a TA to tell them what is going on.  In particul
	ar\, we will need to know whether you think you might need more than an add
	itional 24 hours to get it done or whether you can have it in on Friday (To
	 avoid having to set individualized extensions on tests\, we will already h
	ave programmed into Brightspace an extra 24 hour no questions asked makeup/
	grace period for Friday). But similar to the "no questions asked" makeup pe
	riod for the weekly assessments\, just because the exams will be available 
	on brightspace for late submission for an extra day\, do not just mentally 
	adjust the due date in your mind and leave the exam until that day without 
	contacting anyone. If you leave a test until the makeup day without excuse/
	documentation on file and without contacting anyone before the Thursday req
	uired deadline to tell them what was going on\, you will not be entitled to
	 additional makeup time if an unexpected crisis arises at the last minute o
	n Friday and we haven't heard from you until that point.  So please err on 
	the side of caution and make contact with a teacher prior to 11:59 PM Thurs

SUMMARY:EXAM 2 (MODULES 8-13) - Due
LOCATION:Spring 2024 PSY 12000-005 DIS
DESCRIPTION:Exam 2 opens Tuesday of finals week and is due Thursday of fina
	ls week (11:59 PM).  It will be deployed through the BRIGHTSPACE QUIZZING T
	OOL (link will be provided in this module) which will be able to randomly s
	elect questions of comparable difficulty that cover certain concepts from a
	 pool of several options. Thus\, no two exams will be the same. \nThe exam 
	is timed at 75 minutes and contains 50 multiple choice and true/false quest
	ions (4 pts each) over modules 8-13. A separate link to a separate set of c
	umulative extra credit questions will also be posted covering material from
	 the first half of the course. You get one attempt at each.  The exam must 
	be COMPLETED (SUBMITTED) by end of day Thursday (so DO NOT START IT at 11:5
	8 PM).  Also\, DO NOT CLICK TO START THE EXAM until you have a reliable int
	ernet connection\, a distraction-free environment\, and 75 minutes availabl
	e to take the test.  Once you start the exam\, even if you exit out\, the t
	imer will continue to run in the background and you will not be able to get
	 back in to finish later if the time is up! It is *YOUR RESPONSIBILITY* to 
	NOT open the test until you are ready to start (to ensure everyone has the 
	same fair 75 minutes after opening the test and seeing the first question).
	  After you submit the exam\, immediately verify a grade registered success
	fully to the gradebook.  If you can't get an accurate grade registered succ
	essfully by 11:59 PM Thursday\, you MUST CONTACT a TA prior to 11:59 PM Thu
	rsday. Once the Thursday due date passes\, if you have not contacted anyone
	 with concerns/explanations as to why you have not registered an accurate g
	rade yet\, you will not be eligible for any additional personal support/ass
	istance. (If you did send us a note prior to the Thursday due date\, just s
	it tight and wait for a response).  \nPolicies for your exam submission: Th
	e exam is open note and open book\, and no proctoring software will be used
	 to lock down your computer.  You simply need to have received no informati
	on about the question content prior to opening it (through any format)\, an
	d then you must submit it ON YOUR OWN using the course materials (no collab
	oration with people before\, during\, or after regarding the specific quest
	ions).  You also may not help anyone else with the questions or exam conten
	t while they have their exam open\, or help by giving them information (thr
	ough any format) about question content beforehand. See the syllabus for mo
	re info. Feel free to chat on piazza before Tuesday about any general study
	 guide/content questions - just do not communicate about specific question 
	content once the test is open. Of course\, ensuring everyone is seeing a di
	fferent version of the test will help reduce the temptation to collaborate.
	 :-) We allow a lot of collaboration on other things in this course\, and n
	ow is your chance to show us what you can do on your own.\nEveryone gets on
	e fair shot at each test and is only permitted to open an exam once - once 
	you open the exam\, you are not eligible for a makeup. Do not open it if yo
	u aren't ready to take it.\nMAKEUP POLICY:\nBecause you have a full 3 day w
	indow to submit your test  (and you don't have to be physically present in 
	a classroom)\, we expect people to be able to submit the exam during the re
	quired window. Please take the submission window seriously and don't open t
	he 75 minute test at the last minute on Thursday. Recall that the syllabus 
	states that if you can't get an accurate grade registered by the Thursday d
	ue date\, you MUST contact a TA to tell them what is going on.  In particul
	ar\, we will need to know whether you think you might need more than an add
	itional 24 hours to get it done or whether you can have it in on Friday (To
	 avoid having to set individualized extensions on tests\, we will already h
	ave programmed into Brightspace an extra 24 hour no questions asked makeup/
	grace period for Friday). But similar to the "no questions asked" makeup pe
	riod for the weekly assessments\, just because the exams will be available 
	on brightspace for late submission for an extra day\, do not just mentally 
	adjust the due date in your mind and leave the exam until that day without 
	contacting anyone. If you leave a test until the makeup day without excuse/
	documentation on file and without contacting anyone before the Thursday req
	uired deadline to tell them what was going on\, you will not be entitled to
	 additional makeup time if an unexpected crisis arises at the last minute o
	n Friday and we haven't heard from you until that point.  So please err on 
	the side of caution and make contact with a teacher prior to 11:59 PM Thurs
	day if you can't get a grade registered in time.\n\n\nQuizzes:\nEXAM 2 (MOD
