GDaAWS

Grades are not negotiable. If you are concerned about your grade being lower than you expect
or would like, talk to the TA/instructor as soon as possible. Do not wait until the last few weeks
of the semester when most assignments have already been completed.

Attendance policy

Classroom engagement is extremely important and associated with your overall success in the
course. You are expected to attend all classes, to come prepared by having read the book
chapters for the topic(s) and reviewed your notes from past classes. There are no points given for
attendance.

Academic Integrity

You are expected to abide by the Universitys anti-discrimination and academic honesty policies.
You are expected to behave in class in a way which is respectful of other participants, including
the instructor. There will be an honor code in effect for the class. You will refrain from cheating
on any quiz, exam, or the assignments, and will do your best to ensure nobody cheats from you.
If any behavior consistent with cheating is detected, students will receive zero for that
assignment and/or fail the course, and the matter will be referred to the Dean of Students.

Purdues Honor Pledge: As a boilermaker pursuing academic excellence, I pledge to be honest
and true in all that I do. Accountable together - we are Purdue."

Purdue University values intellectual integrity and the highest standards of academic conduct. To
be prepared to meet societal needs as leaders and role models, students must be educated in an
ethical learning environment that promotes a high standard of honor in scholastic work.
Academic dishonesty undermines institutional integrity and threatens the academic fabric of
Purdue University. Dishonesty is not an acceptable avenue to success. It diminishes the quality
of a Purdue education which is valued because of Purdues high academic standards.

Purdue prohibits dishonesty in connection with any University activity. Cheating, plagiarism, or
knowingly furnishing false information to the University are examples of dishonesty.
[University Regulations, Part 5, Section III, B, 2, a] Furthermore, the University Senate has
stipulated that the commitment of acts of cheating, lying, and deceit in any of their diverse
forms (such as the use of substitutes for taking examinations, the use of illegal cribs, plagiarism,
and copying during examinations) is dishonest and must not be tolerated. Moreover, knowingly
to aid and abet, directly or indirectly, other parties in committing dishonest acts is in itself
dishonest. [University Senate Document 72-18, December 15, 1972]. Additional information
concerning Academic Integrity may be found in the online brochure, Academic Integrity: A
Guide for Students from the Dean of Students office.
